jenkins_setup
-------------

This role automates the installation and configuration of a Jenkins server on a pipeline server, specifically tailored for Amazon Linux 2 (with support for other Red Hat-based systems). It performs the following tasks:

- Installs Java 11 (using `amazon-linux-extras` for Amazon Linux or standard package managers for other systems).
- Installs Git and Jenkins using the official Jenkins repository.
- Configures Jenkins by unlocking it, setting up an admin user, and completing the setup wizard.
- Installs specified Jenkins plugins and sets up GitHub credentials for repository access.
- Generates a Jenkins API token for secure automation.
- Uses Ansible Vault to securely manage sensitive data like admin passwords and GitHub credentials.

This role is ideal for setting up a Jenkins server as part of a CI/CD pipeline, such as for an EKS cluster environment with tools like ArgoCD, Prometheus, and SonarQube.

Requirements
------------

- **Ansible Version**: Ansible 2.9 or higher is required.
- **Community.General Collection**: This role uses the `community.general.jenkins_script` and `community.general.jenkins_plugin` modules. Install the collection with:
  ```bash
  ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
